- what does the sequence of an organism's genome tell us?
- the order of these bases is functional, in that it encodes information, such as the instructions to make proteins
- in that example, knowing this sequence of DNA bases allows us to look at the cell's set of instructions for producing proteins
- sequencing an organism's genome allows us to look at the instructions for an organism, but as researchers, what do we do with that information?
- actually we use genomes for lots of different types of research, and these are just a few examples
- comparing genomes can help us work out what causes the differences between the organisms
- or tell us something about the genomic changes that occurred as the two genomes evolved separately after they split from their last common ancestor
- on a finer scale, we might want to look at genomic variants within species or populations, to compare individuals of that species
- this is an example you might have seen before
- it's the global SARS-Cov2 phylogeny deposited on nextstrain
- this is based on sequencing the genomes of individual SARS-Cov2 isolates and comparing them to each other
- and this sort of information allows us to track the origin of different variants, and monitor their spread
- looking at the variation between the sequences of isolates also allows us to make predictions about the function of the different isolates
- and we can also track the evolution of isolates and work out evolutionary relationships between isolates
- we also use genome sequencing for clinical genetics
- as i said earlier we can look at the instructions for producing proteins by looking at the sequence of genes in the nuclear genome
- if we have an individual with a disease and see that they have a mutation in the coding sequence for a gene associated with that disease, and that mutation changes the protein sequence encoded by the gene, then we can determine what the underlying cause of the disease is in that individual
- we also sequence genomes in research settings as a reference for other types of analysis
- for example when we sequence mRNA molecules to compare the strength of expression of genes in different conditions
- to do this, we need a reference genome so we can work out which gene each read came from
- these are just some examples, but there are many other use cases
- constructing a genome is really one of the basic steps if you're studying the biology a system that hasn't been extensively studied before

# How is *de novo* assembly different to multiple sequence alignment?

\centering

- ***de novo***: from scratch, without a reference
- literally: anew, over again from the beginning
- $\text{sequencing reads} \pm \text{structural information} \rightarrow  \text{genome sequence}$

- what do we mean by de novo assembly?
- de novo assembly refers specifically to the situation where you are trying to produce a new assembly without a reference
- for example if you want to do any of the analyses from the previous slide on an organism that hasn't been studied before
- or the reference genome is inadequate
- for example you might be interested in structural variants that are not in the reference genome for your species of interest
- you'll be familiar with multiple sequence alignments from previous lectures
- this sequence alignment is actually a type of assembly: we take the reads, line them up against at reference, and use that to generate a consensus
- in this example there are two differences in the consensus sequence compared to the reference.
- in de novo assembly, we're specifically talking about the situation when this reference sequence isn't available or we choose not to use it
- the goal is to create the consensus sequence from the sequencing reads, without aligning to a reference genome
- sometimes we have some structural information about how the consensus sequences should be grouped together, and i'll cover that in a later video

- let's just recap what's in the genome
- in this diagram the cell on the right represents a prokaryotic bacterial cell
- the dna is contained in the single, cicular, chromosome, which is folded in the centre of the cell
- there is also dna in the smaller, independently-replicating plasmids shown as dots
- the left hand cell is a eukaryotic cell such as an animal or plant cell
- its genetic material is organised into chromatin, which forms compact chromosomes inside the nucleus
- eukaryotic cells also have mitochondria (kidney beans), which contain their own genetic material 
- this is called the mitochondrial genome
- plant cells also have chloroplasts for photosynthesis, and chloroplasts have their own genetic material
- prokaryotes usually have smaller genomes, with one chromosome that is quite compact
- they have some extrachromosomal genetic material in plasmids
- prokaryotic cells also often contain virus-like particles called bacteriophage, that also contain a small amount of genetic material
- in comparison eukaryotic genomes can be quite large
- genes are often broken up by introns
- and the intergenic sequence between genes can contain large non-coding elements as well as mobile genetic elements, which are stretches of DNA that can move around the genome from generation to generation
- the nuclear genome also contains large repetitive sequences like centromeres and telomores
- eukaryotes also have extrachromosomal material like the mitochondrial genome
- and plant cells additionally have genetic material in their chloroplasts
- but for both types of organism, it's the sum of cellular genetic material that makes up the cell's genome, even though the word "genome" is often used to refer to the nuclear genome of eukaryotes or the chromosomal genome of prokaryotes

- this diagram represents the genome of a strain of the bacterium *E. coli*
- it's shown as a circle, because like in most prokaryotes, the main *E. coli* genome is a single circular chromosome
- this diagram doesn't include any of the extracellular material I mentioned on the previous slide
- the scale bar here is showing you the size of the genome
- this genome assembly is about 160 kb (160 thousand bases) long
- if you look at the outer ring in this diagram, each of the little red arrows represents a predicted coding sequence, or a gene
- you can't see them all on this diagram, but this genome has over 5 thousand genes in about 160 kb
- most prokaryotic genes don't have introns (which are non-coding regions of DNA that are removed during mRNA processing)
- so bacterial genomes in general are quite coding dense, meaning that there are lots of genes packed close together with little intergenic sequence

- in contrast, the nuclear genome of eukaryotes is generally larger, ranging from about 2 million bases to several hundred billion bases
- again, when i say nuclear genome, i'm referring to the chromosomes inside the nucleus, which is where most of the genetic material is stored by eukaryotes
- unlike prokaryote genomes, the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes can be quite sparse, with coding sequences or genes separated by large stretches of non-coding sequence
- for examples, eukaryotic chromosomes have highly repetetive sequences at the end of their chromosomes called telomeres, which don't have open reading frames or regions that encode genes
- another example is the centromere region where the two chromatids that make up the chromosome are joined, which is also highly repetitive and doesn't encode genes

- eukaryotic genes often contain additional sequence apart from the regions that encode proteins
- the protein coding-regions, or coding sequence, of this gene is shown in red
- there are also parts of the gene between the exons, that are called introns, that are removed when the mRNA is processed
- there are other parts of the mature RNA that are not translated into proteins
- there are also regulatory sequences in the DNA surrounding the genes (not shown in this diagram), which control when and where the gene is transcribed into messenger RNA
- pseudogenes are dna sequences that are related to sequences of known genes, but are not functional
- aside from genes, huge portions of eukaryotic genomes can be made up of repetitive sequences, including transposons and retrotransposons, which are mobile genetic elements
- these elements move around the genome can carry functional sequences with them, which can cause mutations in genes or lead to changes in gene expression

- The genome is fragmented for sequencing
- The sequencing ***reads*** might be
    - 100-350 b long (Illumina)
    - ~20 kb long (PacBio HiFi)
    - up to a few hundred thousand bases long (Nanopore)
- ***Assembly*** is the process of reconstructing the genome from the sequenced reads
- It's not always possible to assemble the complete sequence

- we know what a genome is and why we might want to sequence it
- how do we go about producing a genome sequence?
- in this diagram the coloured bar represents a genomic sequence
- so you can think of the bar as one chromosome from the nuclear genome of a eukaryote, or a single bacterial chromosome
- this single sequence might be thousands or millions of bases long, and we can't sequence the whole thing in one go
- this is because of the limitations in sequencing technology
- if we're using illumina sequencing, we can only generate reads of up to 350 b, but usually 100 or 150 b
- long-read technology such as PacBio HiFi reads are about 20 kb l;ong
- and oxford nanopore reads can be up to a few hundred thousand bases long
- because we have to sequence small chunks of the genome at a time, we need many copies of the starting material as input for sequencing
- this might come from many cells from the same organism or tissue, or a culture of identical bacterial cells
- for genome assembly, the sequencing process goes like this:
- we take our sample, and use some molecular biology skills to extract purified dna from it
- we break up the extracted DNA into chunks that can be sequenced by whatever technology we're using
- and then we use some algorithm to try to reconstruct the original genome sequence from the reads we have
- now, in this diagram we don't actually need a very complicated algorithm, because the reads are colour-coded as to what part of the genome they came from
- so we can just arrange them by colour and then look at the sequence of the reads
- in a real sequencing project we have no idea which part of the the genome the reads came from, all we have is the sequence itself
- so we need an algorithm that can use the sequence to try to join the reads together and reconstruct the original sequence, which turns out to be quite complicated for anything other than the simplest starting material
- i'm going to introduce some of the algorithms in the next video
- because we had to fragment the genome to sequence it, we often aren't able to completely reassemble it into one single piece
- this problem is compounded for genomes that have more than one chromosome
- and i'll talk about some of the other challenges in this process a bit later on

- ***Hierarchical shotgun*** Sanger sequencing
- Short read, Illumina sequencing
    - 100--350 b
    - sometimes called ***high-throughput***, ***next-generation*** (!) or ***2^nd^-generation sequencing***
    - good for draft assemblies of eukaryote genomes
- Long read (***third-generation***) sequencing
    - PacBio: ~ 20 kb reads
    - Nanpore: up to 100s of kb, read *N*~50~ usually > 20 kb
    - expect much better contiguity, but can have accuracy issues

- i'm just going to recap the different sequencing options for generating data for a de novo genome assembly
- i've included sanger sequencing here, which is the first-generation sequencing technology
- this approach used on the human genome project which was completed in 2001
- in this process the starting material was into structures called bacterial artificial chromosomes
- the clones were sequenced in small pieces using the sanger sequencing technique
- this actually yielded a pretty good first draft of the human genome
- however it's far too labour intensive to be used for any sequencing projects today
- typically what would be used today is short-read sequencing
- this yields reads from 100 to 350 bases long
- you sometimes hear it called high throughput sequencing HTS
- or next-generation sequencing (NGS)
- it may have been next-generation in the early 2000s but it probably doesn't make sense to call it that any more
- you can also call it second generation sequencing, but it's often just called illumina sequencing because that's the dominant platform
- its main benefits are that it's cheap to produce lots and lots of data, and the read accuracy is generally very high
- illumina sequencing alone might be good enough to generate a quality assembly for a compact bacterial genome without much repeat sequence
- however for more complex eukaryote genomes with lots of repetitive sequence, we would expect an assembly based on illumina sequencing alone to struggle to produce an assembly
- if you're trying to assemble a human genome, you might be aiming to produce one sequence for each of the 22 autosomes plus one or two for the sex chromosomes and a few sequences for the extrachromosomal material in the cells
- with illumina data you'd probably end up with maybe thousands of sequences, because the short reads don't allow the difficult regions to be assembled
- although the sequences that were assembled would be high-accuracy
- long read sequencing obviously generates longer reads, around 20 kb for PacBio or possibly longer for oxford nanopore
- the main drawback for these approaches is that the accuracy is lower, particularly for oxford nanopore sequencing. it is getting better all the time, but it's still quite a way behind the accuracy of illumina sequencing.
- however if you are assembling a genome with long reads, you can expect much higher contiguity (meaning the genome is represented in fewer sequences) than a short-read only genome
- and if you have gaps in your short-read assembly, long reads that span those gaps are the only way to fill in the missing sequence

# Sequencing coverage

- aim to cover each base > 30 times
- final sequence is the ***consensus*** of all the reads covering that base
- $\text{1 Gb} \times \text{30Ã coverage} = \text{30 Gb}$
- $\frac{\text{30 Gb}}{\text{150 b}} = \text{200 million reads}$
- using PacBio reads, with an average length of 20 kb?

- during the sequencing process we've broken the starting material up into smaller fragments, and we need to make sure we sequence enough fragments to cover each base in the genome multiple times
- there two main reasons for this
- the first is to make sure we have enough data to join different sequences together
- in this location we have a base that is only covered by one read, and one read would not be considered enough evidence that the sequence on the right is joined to the sequence on the left
- the second is to help deal with sequencing errors
- all sequencing technologies can produce errors, where a read has an incorrect base in it
- if we have multiple reads covering a single genomic location, the reads can effectively "vote" for what the correct sequence should be
- that's called the consensus sequence
- as it happens most algorithms are happy enough with sequencing coverage around 30x\
- so if our example genome here is 1 gigabase, or one billion bases long
- and we want to sequence it to thirty fold coverage
- we need to produce 30 gigabases of sequence data
- if our read length is 150 b, like in illumina sequencing, that means we would want 200 million reads to get that level of coverage
- and i'll leave it for you to calculate how much PacBio data we'd need at an average read length of 20 thousand bases to get the same coverage

- of course a really powerful strategy is to combine long and short reads
- this is called hybrid assembly
- you'll be learning more about this in the workshop on friday
- in this approach you get a short read dataset and a long read dataset, and you combine them to produce a highly contiguous assembly with high accuracy
- it's essentially the best of both worlds
- and then if you add a scaffolding dataset you can generate a high quality chromosome-level assembly
- one thing i didn't mention that is really important is that the input DNA used for sequencing really needs to be of the highest possible quality
- it's particularly important for long-read sequencing, because DNA that's in poor condition is likely to generate shorter sequencing reads
- as bioinformaticians there's not much we can do retrospectively if sequencing has been done on a less-than-ideal sample, but it's important to keep dna quality in mind in the planning stages of a genome assembly project
- from a review called "Guidance on achieving highâquality reference genomes"
